          Avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine before bedtime can
          help improve sleep quality. Alcohol may make you feel drowsy, but it

          Good sleep is also linked to good nutrition. Eating a healthy and

          Electronic devices emit blue light that can disrupt the body's natural
          sleep-wake cycle, so it's important to avoid using them in the hour
          leading up to bedtime. Instead, try relaxing activities like reading
          or taking a bath.
